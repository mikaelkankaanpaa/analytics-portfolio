# Data Analytics Portfolio - Mikael Kankaanpää
A small collection of examples from analytics projects (coursework + free time) that demonstrate my ability to turn data into **insight**, **usable tools**, and **decision support** — using Python, ML/AI methods, and Excel/VBA automation. 

## Projects

---

## 1) Premier League Player Performance Analytics (Python)
**Goal:** Analyze Premier League player performance to surface **top performers**, **over/under-performance**, and other relevant insights, following a typical, end-to-end data analysis workflow and by utilizing AI modeling. 

**What's Inside:**
- End-to-end analysis notebook: data collection > merging > cleaning > feature engineering > EDA > clustering > modeling.   
- Interactive visuals (Plotly) and a dynamic Dash component for exploring top scorers and distributions.   
- Modeling:
  - K-Means segmentation based on player performance.   
  - Predictive Machine Learning (Random Forest model) to estimate player ratings from performance metrics.

- ▶️ Run the notebook online: [Project 1 - Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mikaelkankaanpaa/analytics-portfolio/blob/main/1-python-performance-analytics-project/code/analytics-project.ipynb)

**Tools:** Python with pandas, NumPy, scikit, Matplotlib, Plotly, Dash, Jupyter Widgets

## 2) AI & ML Model Implementations (Python)
**Goal:** Build practical intuition for core AI/ML approaches by implementing and evaluating models across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and probabilistic methods.

**What's Inside:**
- **Supervised learning:** Neural network for MNIST image classification with optimizable hyperparameters.
- **Reinforcement learning:** Q-learning agent for OpenAI Gym Taxi-v3 using epsilon-greedy exploration.
- **Probabilistic models:** Naive Bayes and full Bayesian classifiers for MNIST/Fashion-MNIST, including robustness checks with noisy inputs.

  - [Bayesian Classifiers](TODO)

**Tools:** Python with TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy/SciPy, OpenAI Gym, Scikit.

## 3) Sales Analytics Dashboard Automation (Excel + VBA)


**Goal:** Build an interactive dashboard for sales analysis and pricing visualization using data from a gamified business simulation* (RealGame).

**What's Inside**
- An Excel reporting workbook that turns raw data exports into a navigable dashboard view.
- VBA automation to update category-level pricing visuals and streamline reporting workflows.
- Pivot-based analysis with slicers to quickly filter and compare segments.

**Tools:** Excel, Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, VBA macros. 

\* This is a small excerpt from analysis associated with the course "Business Decisions and Market Analytics", which was structured around the RealGame simulation.

## Notes
- Only projects based on public datasets (Kaggle / MNIST / OpenAI Gym) or course-provided simulator data (RealGame) are included in this portfolio. 
- If you're reviewing this as part of an application and want a quick walkthrough, feel free to reach out.
